# Malware-Detection-Using-a-Single-Bidirectional-Graph-Embedding
## overview
We are interested in the detection and classification of malware based on a new graph coding framework. The single-bi-directional graph coding framework is based on a Keras implementation.
## Datasets
The dataset is too large to upload here. We provide sample data as well as the source of the data. We used the data pre-processing approach in the paper to process the data from the original API call sequence of the sample software and obtain the "sample_data.csv".  
The first dataset's data is from the Alibaba-Security-Algorithm-Challenge, and the related web site is: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231694/information  
The second dataset's data is from the work of “Deep learning based Sequential model for malware analysis using Windows exe API Calls”, and the related web site is: https://github.com/ocatak/malware_api_class
