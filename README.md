## overview
We are interested in the detection and classification of malware based on a new graph coding framework. The single-bi-directional graph coding framework is based on a Keras implementation.
## Datasets
The dataset is from the work of “Deep learning based Sequential model for malware analysis using Windows exe API Calls”, and the related web site is: https://github.com/ocatak/malware_api_class
## Usage:
### 1.Predict
See code(Predict.ipynb)for details
